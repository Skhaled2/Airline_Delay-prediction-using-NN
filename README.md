#Airline Delay Prediction using Neural Networks
Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network model to predict the causes of airline delays. The model is trained on the "Airline Delay Cause" dataset, which contains information about flight delays, their causes, and other relevant features.

Dataset
The "Airline Delay Cause" dataset is used in this project. It contains the following features:

year: The year of the flight
month: The month of the flight
carrier: The airline carrier
carrier_name: The name of the airline carrier
airport: The airport code
airport_name: The name of the airport
arr_flights: The number of arriving flights
arr_del15: The number of flights delayed by 15 minutes or more
carrier_ct: The number of delays caused by the airline carrier
weather_ct: The number of delays caused by weather
nas_ct: The number of delays caused by the National Air System
security_ct: The number of delays caused by security
late_aircraft_ct: The number of delays caused by late aircraft
arr_cancelled: The number of cancelled arriving flights
arr_diverted: The number of diverted arriving flights
arr_delay: The total arrival delay in minutes
carrier_delay: The arrival delay caused by the airline carrier
weather_delay: The arrival delay caused by weather
nas_delay: The arrival delay caused by the National Air System
security_delay: The arrival delay caused by security
late_aircraft_delay: The arrival delay caused by late aircraft
Methodology
The project follows these steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and inspected for any missing or erroneous values. Necessary transformations and feature engineering are performed to prepare the data for model training.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is analyzed to identify patterns, relationships, and insights that can inform the model development process.
Model Development: A neural network model is developed using the Keras library. The model architecture, hyperparameters, and training process are designed and optimized to achieve the best possible performance.
Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to assess its performance in predicting the causes of airline delays.
Model Deployment: The trained model is saved and can be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of neural networks for predicting the causes of airline delays. The model can be further improved and deployed in a real-world setting to assist airlines and airport authorities in better understanding and managing the factors contributing to flight delays.
